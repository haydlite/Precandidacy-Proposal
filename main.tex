\section{Introduction}



The "alt-right"\footnote{§2.1 discusses the stylistic choice of quotation marks
here.} has an inordinate influence on
American political discourse \cite{,
brydenUnderlyingSociopoliticalProcesses2019,
schreckingerAltRightComesWashington}. This is a cause for concern, not only because
the movement has motivated a number of terrorist acts
\cite{laqueurFutureTerrorismISIS2018, bjorgoExtremeRightViolenceTerrorism,
castleWhiteRacialActivism2020}, but also as their
rhetoric poses a existential threat to democratic social and cultural values
\cite{danielsCyberRacismWhite2009}.

One of the key drivers behind the "alt-right"'s increasing influence is their
successful emphasis on \textit{mainstreaming}, a process where fringe ideas are
repackaged for wider consumption in an effort to normalize them
\cite{sternProudBoysWhite2019, mainRiseAltRight2018,
cammaertsMainstreamingExtremeRightWing2018}. Examples of mainstreaming
range from coded
expressions of racism to normalization of ideas previously thought
unacceptable in polite conversation
\cite{cammaertsMainstreamingExtremeRightWing2018}. Mainstreaming as a
strategy to further political influence is rooted in Gramscian thought
\cite{nagleKillAllNormies2017, sternProudBoysWhite2019}. Antonio Gramsci, an
Italian Marxist philosopher, postulated that
non-dominant groups seeking to effect radical change in a civil
society cannot do so through confrontation, as encounters would likely evolve
into unfavorable wars of attrition \cite{delzellAntonioGramsciOrigins1967}. So,
he suggests, they must instead influence culture such that it propels
institutional change in their favor; he terms this approach engaging in a
\textit{war-of-position} \cite{buttigiegGramsciCivilSociety1995}. The hallmark
of the "alt-right"'s making headway in their war-of-position is the election
of Donald Trump, a president
not only friendly to but also a superspreader of their previously-considered
fringe ideas \cite{brydenUnderlyingSociopoliticalProcesses2019}.

Continued growth in the "alt-right"'s political influence is far from a distant
possibility---they enjoy a sizeable sympathetic audience in the current
American political climate. \citet{hawleyDemographyAltRight2018} estimates that
roughly 6\% of non-Hispanic whites have beliefs in line with white nationalism.
He arrived at 6\% by filtering for non-Hispanic white responses to the 2016
American National Election Survey (ANES) then determining the ratio of
responses where "a strong sense of white identity", "a belief in the importance
of white solidarity", and "a sense of white victimization" were all rated as
"very" or "extremely" important. In addition to the 6\% who gave all of those items a
high importance rating, many respondents agreed with at least one of the three
statements: 28\% held a strong sense of white identity, 38\% believed in the
importance of white solidarity, and 27\% held a sense of white victimization. A
2017 Reuters/Ipsos poll found similar patterns: 39\% \footnote{Unlike
\citet{hawleyDemographyAltRight2018}, these percentages are not after filtering
for non-Hispanic whites.} of respondents strongly or somewhat agreed with the
statement, "White people are currently under attack in this country"; 31\%
strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement, "American must protect and
preserve its White European heritage"; 6\% explicitly strongly or somewhat
support the "alt-right"; 8\% strongly or somewhat support white nationalism;
and 4\% strongly or somewhat support neo-Nazism \cite{politicsNewPollAmericans}.

The major blocker between the "alt-right" and more widespread conservative
acceptance is shared
rejection of flagrant racism. Despite their formidable strides in political
influence and the
conditions of possibility described, the "alt-right" remains a fringe movement
as many sympathizers (and potential converts) disavow white supremacy and assert statuses as non-
racists \cite{mainRiseAltRight2018,
hawleyAltRightWhatEveryone2018}.
These sympathizers, similar in many ideological and demographic dimensions to
to "alt-right" members
but disapproving of white-identity politics, have been dubbed \textit{"alt-
lite"}
\cite{mainRiseAltRight2018, hawleyAltRightWhatEveryone2018}. Both "alt-right"
leaders and scholars
speculate that that the "alt-lite" are a potential conduit through which the
"alt-right" can reach a wider audience and, consequently, grow their cultural
influence. Though many scholarly works consider the "alt-right" \cite{mainRiseAltRight2018,
hawleyMakingSenseAltright2017, nagleKillAllNormies2017}
and related matters such as their mainstreaming
efforts \cite{gallaherMainstreamingWhiteSupremacy2020} and its effect on public
discourse
\cite{sternProudBoysWhite2019, cammaertsMainstreamingExtremeRightWing2018},
details about how the
"alt-lite" distinguishes itself from the "alt-right" and contributes to the
latter's mainstreaming
persist as open questions. To address this research gap, I will analyze "alt-
right" and "alt-lite"
discussions and networks on Twitter, focusing on the following research
questions:

\begin{enumerate}[font={\bfseries},label={{RQ}\arabic*.}]
	\item What are the distinctive characteristics of "alt-right" or "alt-lite"
  Twitter? How do they contrast with general Twitter?

	\item How are "alt-right", "alt-lite", and general Twitter's networks
  connected?

	\item Does the "alt-lite" mediate diffusion of "alt-right" ideas? If so, how?
\end{enumerate}

I will address:
\begin{itemize}
	\item RQ1 by examining the communities’ network structures and language use
	\item RQ2 by analyzing
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item communities’ networks’ (represented as graphs) exterior pointing edges
	      	      (i.e. edges that connect community users to non-community users) and
	      	      overlapping users (individuals who are members of multiple communities)
	      	\item Hawkes processes capturing Twitter as a multi-speaker
	      	      conversation
	      \end{itemize}
	\item RQ3 by considering "ideas" as different units of speech (words, n-grams, hashtags, topic models, and frames as depicted by word embeddings) and hypothesis testing the parameters of
	      \begin{itemize}
	      	\item Hawkes
	      	      processes to determine which communities hold influence in another
	      	      communities’ discourse
	      	\item logistic regressions predicting diffusion of ideas from
	      	      "alt-right" discourse to general public discourse to pinpoint and compare relative importance of idea diffusion mechanisms.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

I will contribute to scholarly understanding of "alt-right"
mainstreaming efforts by providing language markers with which to differentiate between
"alt-right" and "alt-lite" rhetoric, defining the two groups' relationship to one another and
mainstream discourse through a social network analysis lens, and pinpointing social media mechanisms
that expedite "alt-right" idea diffusion.

\medskip

The remainder of this proposal is organized as follows: I explain deliberate style and language
choices. Then, I review previous work, detailing current scholarly understanding of the "alt-right"
and "alt-lite". Closing my proposal, I outline my intended methodology and timeline.

\section{Style and Language}

\subsection{"Alt-Right" and "Alt-Lite"}

I follow other scholars’ \cite{hartzellAltWhiteConceptualizingAltRight, massanariRethinkingResearchEthics2018} and the
Associated Press’s (AP) \cite{johndaniszewskiWritingAltright2016} styling of "alt-right".
Both academic and journalist experts caution that using the
phrase "alt-right" lends undue political legitimacy to a group predominantly
composed of white nationalists and supremacists by obscuring that
connection. As such, many opt to highlight their unenthusiastic use of
"alt-right" with "quotation marks, hyphen and lower case"
\cite{johndaniszewskiWritingAltright2016} to remind readers of the complexity belying the
descriptor. I style "alt-lite" in a similar manner for the same reasons.

\subsubsection{Describing Far-Right Groups}

Experts vary in their labels, descriptions, and distinctions for far-right movements and
subgroups. This is partially the result of earlier academic and journalist work
that interchanged labels without greater deliberation
\cite{muddeFarRightToday2019}. However,
far-right individuals themselves also share responsibility:
leaders of the same group disagree on basic points
such as whether their platform can be considered racist \cite{muddeFarRightToday2019}.
Academics agree that the movements we observe and discuss here fall under the very broad umbrella of right-wing politics \cite{muddeFarRightToday2019}. However, they lack consensus on many other judgments, importantly how to distinguish different far-right groups from one another and what each group's core features or motivations are \cite{muddeFarRightToday2019}.

In Table \ref{table:key-terms}, I outline my concepts of the far-right groups mentioned in this proposal. My definitions weigh and reconcile competing frames in an effort to provide fair representations.

\begin{table*}
\caption{Key Far-Right Groups}
\label{table:key-terms}
\begin{tabular}{ p{3cm}  p{7cm}  p{6cm} }

  \toprule
  Group & Key Features & Additional Notes \\
  \midrule
  "Alt-Right" & The Internet-age reincarnation or offshoot of white nationalism. Members enthusiastically endorse white identity politics, hyper-masculinity, and bio-essentialism \cite{sternProudBoysWhite2019}.
  
  \medskip
  
  Their social media and optics savvy sets them apart from white nationalist predecessors; for example, more experienced members take care to advise new members to distance themselves from symbols or imagery tied to Nazism or the Ku Klux Klan \cite{sternProudBoysWhite2019, hawleyMakingSenseAltright2017}.

   & Some experts are skeptical that the "alt-right" can or should be understood as a group or movement separate from white nationalism or supremacy \cite{hartzellAltWhiteConceptualizingAltRight, johndaniszewskiWritingAltright2016}. \\ 
  \hline
  "Alt-Lite" & The "lite" version of the "alt-right". They bear strong demographic and ideological resemblance to the "alt-right", but distinguish themselves from the more well-known group by expressly valuing civic nationalism over white nationalism \cite{mainRiseAltRight2018,hawleyAltRightWhatEveryone2018,lyonsInsurgentSupremacistsFar2018}. & It remains an open question whether it is possible to distinguish between "alt-right" and "alt-lite" beyond the civic vs white nationalism criterion. Given the "alt-right"'s mindfulness of standards of social acceptability, an "alt-right" member's publicly expressed points of view may be indistinguishable from an "alt-lite" member's \cite{hartzellAltWhiteConceptualizingAltRight}. 
  \\
  \hline
  Far Right & Encompasses both the \textit{extreme right} and the \textit{radical right}. 
  
  \medskip
  
  The extreme right opposes democracy; many members support fascism. 
  
  \medskip 
  
  The radical right accepts democracy (e.g. they support the idea of majority rule), but rejects key tenets of liberal democracy, such as multiculturalism, plurality, or minority rights. & Different factions of the "alt-right" fall into extreme vs radical right. However, "alt-right" ideology can squarely be understood as far right \cite{muddeFarRightToday2019}.\\
  \hline
  White Supremacist & A white supremacist is "a person who believes that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races" \cite{merriam-websterDefinitionWHITESUPREMACIST}. & I took the liberty of quoting Merriam-Webster's definitions for "white supremacist" and "white nationalist" as these phrases, in contrast to the first three on this list, lend themselves to concise definition.\\
  \hline
  White Nationalist & A white nationalist is "one of a group of militant whites who espouse white supremacy and advocate enforced racial segregation" \cite{merriam-websterDefinitionWHITENATIONALIST} & Note that the definition of white nationalist involves white supremacy. Scholarly work \cite{danielsAlgorithmicRiseAltRight2018,  hartzellAltWhiteConceptualizingAltRight} caution that self-labelling as a white nationalist (as opposed to a white supremacist) is a rhetorical move---self-styled white nationalists distance themselves from blatant hatred and racism by arguing their motivation is rooted in identity politics that "fellow" marginalized identity groups are able to enjoy without criticism. \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Mainstreaming or Radicalizing?}

Mainstreaming has many conceptual overlaps with \textit{radicalization}, a more well-known and researched idea,
particularly in criminal justice and computer science literature \cite{torokDevelopingExplanatoryModel2013, groverDetectingPotentialWarning2019, ribeiroAuditingRadicalizationPathways2019}. The
difference between mainstreaming and radicalization lies in the scale of
perception distortion that takes place. Mainstreaming refers to efforts to move an idea from the edges of \textit{general social acceptability} to the center; to mainstream an idea is to
normalize it among many. In contrast, radicalizing refers to warping an \textit{individual's} sense of acceptable
ideas; to radicalize a person involves changing what they individually perceive as normal.

In addition to the differences in scale, "radicalization" suggests terrorist acts as the larger concern at-hand \cite{torokDevelopingExplanatoryModel2013}, which does not convey the "alt-right"'s threat to liberal democracy. Terrorist attacks are well within the scope of concern about the "alt-right", especially as, since Donald
Trump’s election in 2016, a rising number of these extremist-related
killings have been attributed to right-wing extremists (in particular,
white supremacists) \cite{greenblattRightWingExtremistViolence}
\footnote{In 2016, 13\% of domestic extremist-related killings were committed by right-wing extremists. Compare this to 56\%, 78\%, and 86\% in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively \cite{greenblattRightWingExtremistViolence}.}. 
However, the "alt-right" primarily uses discursive techniques to realize its ends. Given this strategy, mainstreaming, rather than radicalization, is the normalization process to monitor.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{"Alt-Right"}

The "alt-right" are a loosely connected group of individuals who predominantly support white supremacy and hyper-masculinity, reject multiculturalism and feminism, and interface with one another primarily through the internet
\cite{sternProudBoysWhite2019, mainRiseAltRight2018, nagleKillAllNormies2017, hawleyMakingSenseAltright2017}.
This description is incomplete and a simplification for
many reasons, including that "alt-right" is applied as a label inconsistently
by supporters and observers alike \cite{hawleyMakingSenseAltright2017} and
"the "alt-right"", as a phrase, suggests a monolithic collective
\cite{massanariRethinkingResearchEthics2018}, which fails to capture the
dispersed and disorganized \cite{martinDissectingTrumpMost2017} nature of the
"alt-right", a 'movement' with no formal membership nor accepted leaders
\cite{hawleyMakingSenseAltright2017}. On top of these issues, experts are
skeptical that those who label themselves "alt-right" have discernible shared
traits aside from those attributed to white supremacists
\cite{gallaherMainstreamingWhiteSupremacy2020,
johndaniszewskiWritingAltright2016}.  With these caveats in mind, literature
surrounding the "alt-right" can be divided into two categories. One strand
describes the "alt-right" as part
of a larger global phenomenon where far-right ideology have been
amassing legitimacy and power through populist politics
\cite{cammaertsMainstreamingExtremeRightWing2018,
worthMorbidSymptomsGlobal2019}. Another positions the
"alt-right" as the internet-age reincarnation of white nationalists
\cite{hawleyMakingSenseAltright2017, mainRiseAltRight2018}. In this review,
I focus on the latter, which centers the "alt-right" as an actor exercising agency, as opposed to a symptom or by-product of external phenomena.

Andrew Anglin, a prominent "alt-right" figure, describes the "alt-right"
as a movement that came out of various internet subcultures (e.g. troll
culture, conspiracy theorism, the manosphere); he states that the "alt-right" can be understood as a reboot of earlier
white nationalist movements \cite{andrewanglinNormieGuideAltRight}. For the most part, experts agree with Anglin \cite{mainRiseAltRight2018, hawleyAltRightWhatEveryone2018, lyonsInsurgentSupremacistsFar2018}.
However, they clash in their portrayals of the \textit{essence} of the "alt-right" \cite{forscherPsychologicalProfileAltRight2020}. Some assert that the "alt-right" "is fundamentally concerned
with race" \cite{hawleyMakingSenseAltright2017}. Others emphasize that the "alt-right" is a white
\textit{male} \footnote{Important to note that despite the misogyny present in
	"alt-right" rhetoric and talking points, the movement is not without its
	women. \citet{forscherPsychologicalProfileAltRight2020} estimate about 44\% of "alt-right"
supporters are women.}
movement, and so gender, as well as race, is a dominant underlying
factor in explaining beliefs and motivation \cite{kuszWinningBiglySporting2019}. \citet{gallaherMainstreamingWhiteSupremacy2020}
examined 1,000 tweets from six alt-right leaders on Twitter and observed
a predominantly cultural and racial lens in their messages’ frames.
Surveying a nationally representative random probability sample of
Americans and considering several accounts of the "alt-right",
\citet{forscherPsychologicalProfileAltRight2020} found the most support for those framing
the "alt-right" profile as one of acceptance of and eagerness to advance
white supremacy, especially at the expense of non-whites. Additionally,
they saw that self-identified "alt-right" members were "more similar
than different" to those who voted for Trump in 2016. Between the two, "alt-right" members were likely to
report greater enthusiasm for Trump, be suspicious of mainstream
media outlets, and support white collective action (e.g. agree with
statements such as "More needs to be done so that people remember
that ``White Lives'' also matter.").

The "alt-right" set themselves apart from other far-right movements with their emphasis on mainstreaming and their social media savvy. The latter has facilitated successes toward the former \cite{sternProudBoysWhite2019, nagleKillAllNormies2017, gallaherMainstreamingWhiteSupremacy2020}. 
\citet{sternProudBoysWhite2019} provides a vignette that testifies to the "alt-right"'s mainstreaming success: As an "alt-right"-imagined conspiracy theory, "white genocide" had scant mention in public discourse. However, it later became the centerpiece issue of a Tucker Carlson news story about how white Southern African farmers were being massacred by their black-African-led government. Later, President Trump announced over Twitter that he had asked his Secretary of State to "closely study the South African land and farm seizures ... and the large scale killing of farmers" \cite{colindwyerHereStoryThat2018}. This is all despite a lack of data to support that farmers were at heightened risk of being killed in comparison to the average South African \cite{SARejectsTrump2018}. This example exemplifies the "alt-right"'s mainstreaming successes, instances in which an "alt-right" idea is propelled from mass disapproval to driving accepted political discourse. As one "alt-right" member boasts, "What Tucker Carlson talks about, we talked about a year ago" \cite{janetreitmanLawEnforcementFailed2018}. 

An open question remains: How do "alt-right" ideas make their way from "alt-right" circles to more mainstream ones? (In Stern's vignette, how did the white South African story make its way to Tucker Carlson's desk?) I will address this research gap when examining how unique discussion topics flow through separate communities and what mechanisms promote that migration. 

\subsection{"Alt-Lite"}

The "alt-lite" separate themselves from the "alt-right" with their
rejection of overt racism \cite{anti-defamationleagueAltRightAlt, mainRiseAltRight2018, hawleyMakingSenseAltright2017}. In other words, while "alt-lite" individuals subscribe
to many (if not most) "alt-right" talking points, they (at least
outwardly) reject tne idea that individuals of different races have different
abilities or are otherwise "not equal". In the words of Richard
Spencer, a leading "alt-right" figure, "The alt-right [sic] fundamentally
differs from Trump’s civic nationalism by considering ‘us’ to be all
people of European ancestry across the globe" \cite{anti-defamationleagueAltRightAlt, mainRiseAltRight2018}. In other words, while the "alt-right" concerns
itself with white people across the globe, the "alt-lite" prioritizes
those within the United States’ borders.

Though some "alt-right" members view the "alt-lite" with derision,
others see the latter as useful "entry point[s] for potential converts"
\cite{hartEntryistsEntryPoint2016}. \citet{ribeiroAuditingRadicalizationPathways2019} found evidence to support
the "entry point" idea on YouTube: in 2018, roughly a
quarter of new "alt-right" commenters (users who comment on an
"alt-right" video for the first time in their YouTube careers) had
previously commented on an "alt-lite" video. They cautioned that while
this statistic indicates association between "alt-lite" and "alt-right" content,
it provides no explanation of potential pathways between the two 
\cite{ribeiroAuditingRadicalizationPathways2019}. Scholars have yet to pinpoint 
the mechanisms behind topic conductance between the "alt-lite" 
and "alt-right".
I will address this knowledge gap by examining the "alt-right" and "alt-lite" as
community networks and determining crucial factors driving topic
diffusion between the two.

\subsection{Measuring Influence via Social Networks and Language Use}

I curated this project's chosen methods from established social network analysis
(SNA) and computational linguistics techniques with previous successful
applications in social science research.

Researchers employ SNA to investigate groups and their intra- and inter-group
relationships and interactions \cite{carringtonModelsMethodsSocial2005}. Closely
related to our work, \citet{morstatterAltRightAltRechtsTwitter2018} employed SNA
methods to distinguish German "alt-right" sub-communities from one another and
discern the sub-communities' different themes in conversation, along with the
flow of information between the sub-communities.

Contemporary computational linguistics is closely aligned with social science
research interests. Computational linguists steadfastly demonstrate interest in
social science applications: \citep{lauOnlineTrendAnalysis} outline how to use
topic models to track emerging trends or interests;
\cite{bammanGenderIdentityLexical2014} cluster and train statistical classifiers
on a Twitter corpus to study the relationship between gender, language use, and
social networks. Similarly, social scientists have advanced computational
linguistics methods by adjusting them to examine questions like "What language
would we expect from a Republican vs a Democrat?" or "How tied are stock prices
to newspaper headlines?"  \cite{monroeFightinWordsLexical2008,
gentzkowTextData2019}.

My applications of SNA and computational linguistics methodology will enable me to thoroughly capture and dissect power, influence, and language use in a networked setting.

\section{Data Procedures}

\subsection{Source of Data}

I will create my dataset by filtering from a Twitter Decahose\footnote{"Twitter
decahose is made available through a Master License Agreement between Twitter,
Inc. and the University of Michigan, and its research use is supported by the
Michigan Institute for Data Science, Advanced Research Computing - Technology
Services, and Consulting for Statistics, Computing \& Analytics Research."} (a
10\% random sample of Twitter Firehose) collection that began late February 2018
and has yet to cease. This strategy (in contrast to starting from scratch and
collecting my own using Twitter API) is the most cost-effective route, both
monetarily and temporally.

Previous quantitative investigations into the AR on Twitter
\cite{bergerAltrightTwitterCensus2018, alizadehPsychologyMoralityPolitical2019} created their datasets by, over
time, crawling identified AR users and collecting relevant data via Twitter API.
The comparative advantage of this approach is that one would have access to
users' follows and followers over time. The Twitter Decahose tweets do not
include user friendship information at time of posting and historical friendship
data is not accessible. However, previous work
\cite{chaMeasuringUserInfluence2010,
versteegInformationtheoreticMeasuresInfluence2013} suggests that user-follower
data is an unhelpful, noisy signal in Twitter information
diffusion inquiries. Additionally, as the main goal of this project is to
investigate a time-series process (how the AL assists in mainstreaming AR ideas)
observing a longer period of time is preferable.

\subsection{Data Collection}

My research questions call for samples of three Twitter communities: "alt-right" (AR), "alt-lite" (AL), and "general".

\subsubsection{"Alt-Right" and "Alt-Lite"}

I will begin collecting accounts contributing to AR discourse\footnote{I expressly
avoid labelling non-public figure users as AR, AL, or otherwise. In other words,
when I include a user as part of a community sample, I am not labelling them as
a community member. Rather, I label them and their tweets as contributing to a
community's discourse\footnote{In some ways, I follow
\citet{salazarAltRightCommunityDiscourse2018}'s suggestion to examine the
"alt-right" as a \textit{community of discourse}}. 	} by referring to the
Anti-Defamation League's \cite{anti-defamationleagueAltRightAlt} and Southern
Poverty Law Center's \cite{southernpovertylawcenterAltRight} publicly available
determinations of AR groups and leading figures for "seed" AR members. I will collect
"seed" tweets from these users and extract retweeted or mentioned Twitter
usernames to complete this community sample.
To collect accounts contributing to AL discourse, I will modify the above approach accordingly.

\subsubsection{General}

I will collect a random sample of users to serve as a control group. This sample's size will be comparable to the other community samples'.

% \subsubsection{Media}

% [Potentially: Include top 36 media outlets (as identified by Pew Research Center) accounts/users to control for media effects \cite{barberaWhoLeadsWho2019}.]


\subsubsection{Additional Features}

Previous works' \cite{bergerAltrightTwitterCensus2018, alizadehPsychologyMoralityPolitical2019} data pre-processing and/or descriptive statistics of AR Twitter suggest features with which to flag users.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Bots

	      A non-trivial segment of the AR Twitter is bot-run \cite{bergerAltrightTwitterCensus2018}. I will use \citet{davisBotOrNotSystemEvaluate2016}'s BotOrNot to determine whether users in my dataset are bots and flag them accordingly.

	\item Reside in the United States

	      I will flag users whose time zones or locations suggest that they are not residing in the United States to leave the potential open of later capturing non-US influence on US public discourse.

	\item Verified status and/or a large number of followers

	      Both \citet{bergerAltrightTwitterCensus2018} and
	      \citet{alizadehPsychologyMoralityPolitical2019} remove atypically popular users from their datasets. Having a verified status on Twitter and/or a
	      "large" (relatively defined) following suggests that one is a public or
	      known figure, so these metrics are good heuristics with which to
	      approximate celebrity. As individual users' level of celebrity likely
	      predictive of network influence, I will flag "celebrity".

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tweets}

All collected Twitter users' tweets are extracted from the Decahose data. I will preprocess tweets' text by lowercasing all characters and removing URLs.

\subsection{Community Networks}

I will construct three distinct undirected graphs that will represent my data as a
social network. Users are represented as nodes; if they are `linked' to one
another, they will have an edge connecting them. One graph will be constructed
using \textit{mentions} and \textit{replies} as links (i.e. if a user mentions
another, their representative nodes will have an edge connecting them). The
second graph is based off of \textit{retweets}. The third graph is potentially
many graphs and connects two users if they share usage of a specialized
term\footnote{Or have term-vectors with a high Jaccard similarity
\cite{niwattanakulUsingJaccardCoefficient2013}.} . I will construct these three
graphs as they hold potentially different insight for my research questions.

% However, if the two graphs end up being highly similar, then I will keep one and discard the other\footnote{I would favor the graph with variance in subsamples.}.


\subsubsection{Community Detection}

This project's overarching goal is to better understand the extent to which one
Twitter community influences the rest of the social media platforms' discourse
and what mechanisms support that influence. Consequently, identifying significant
sub-graphs is useful to discern significantly dense sub-graphs in our
earlier generated graph. These dense sub-graphs are reflective of communities
and identifying them has been shown to be helpful in predicting message
diffusion from one community to another \cite{wengViralityPredictionCommunity2013}. This community detection
is done despite users already having been sorted into communities (by way of my
data collecting process) because contrasting those labels and communities with
those mined using graph features will highlight relevant particulars (e.g. is
there a set of users that act as "in-between" for the "alt-right" and the
"alt-lite" communities?).

To distinguish communities as present in the user network graphs' structures, I
need a community detection framework that performs well on social media
community detection benchmarks, can handle nodes potentially being members of
multiple communities, and is scalable.
\citet{epastoEgoSplittingFrameworkNonOverlapping2017}'s \textit{Ego-Splitting}
framework meets these criteria and is implemented by
\citet{rozemberczkiAPIOrientedOpensource2020}'s
\href{https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/karateclub}{Karate Club}, an
open-source unsupervised machine learning library extension to
\href{https://networkx.github.io/}{NetworkX}. I plan to use it to organize the
user network graphs into communities and to visualize these using NetworkX.

\section{Community Snapshots}

In this section, I detail how I investigate the various communities' characteristics (RQ1) and their relationships with one another (RQ2). I do this both by examining the communities' graph structures (topologically) and their language use.

For all analysis, I will utilize parametric bootstrap sampling \cite{gentzkowMeasuringGroupDifferences2019} to account for finite sample bias and obtain confidence levels for any reported statistics.

\subsection{Topology}

To examine a network's topology is to study how its elements (both nodes and edges) are arranged \cite{goldenbergSurveyStatisticalNetwork2010}. I will explore each community using node and graph properties in order to address questions such as (but not limited to):

\begin{itemize}
	\item How connected are users within a community?
	\item How connected are users to those outside their community (or communities)?
	\item How quickly would one expect information to diffuse from the community to another?
\end{itemize}

I will list and describe potential node and graph properties of interest
\cite{yangDefiningEvaluatingNetwork2015} in Table \ref{table:graph_properties}.
Some properties are concerned about \textit{internal} connectivity (e.g. average
degree, internal density, average geodesic length, clustering coefficient); some
are concerned about \textit{external} connectivity (e.g. expansion, cut ratio);
conductance considers both internal and external connectivity. For the node
properties in Table \ref{table:graph_properties} (average degree and geodesic
length), I will examine them not only as a point value but also as a
distribution.

\begin{table*}

	\caption{Community Network Node and Graph Properties}
	\label{table:graph_properties}

	\begin{tabular}{ p{4cm}  p{4cm}  p{4cm} }

		\toprule
		Property & Description & Addressed Question \\
		\midrule
		Average Degree & Average number of edges per community node & How many connections can we expect a user to have? \\
		\hline
		Internal Density & Fraction of edges that appear between two community nodes & How connected are users to this community as opposed to outside groups? \\
		\hline
		Expansion & Fraction of edges connecting nodes to non-community nodes & How connected are users to non-community users as opposed to same-community ones?                  \\
		\hline
		Average Geodesic Length & Average distance between two community nodes & Would information travel travel quickly from one community user to another, randomly selected one? \\
		\hline
		Clustering Coefficient  & Fraction of ``closed'' community node triplets & How likely is it that three users within a community are all connected to one another?             \\
		\hline
		Conductance & Probability that of a one-step random walk starting on a community node going outside the community & How likely is it that information is traveling outside the community?                              \\
		\hline
		Cut Ratio & Fraction of edges pointing outside the community over possible edges pointing outside & Do users make an active effort to engage with those in different communities?                      \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

In addition to the node and graph properties listed in Table \ref{table:graph_properties}, the following may prove relevant:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each communities' size
	\item Influential users within each community
	\item How the communities detected through graph-based methods match up with my original user labels
	\item Details about users who are in multiple communities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Language}

\subsubsection{Representative Words}

What words distinguish one community's speech from another's? Here, I am interested in
uncovering the words that are more likely to have been said by one community in
contrast to others. Previously, \citet{monroeFightinWordsLexical2008}
demonstrated that weighted log-odds ratios were effective in differentiating
words typical of speech from a Republican vs. a Democrat. I plan to employ their
technique to determine each communities' identifying unigrams and
bigrams. My deliverable from this work will be a table of some finite number of
words with the greatest weighted log-odds ratio for each community and
discussion about the arrived-upon representative words.
\subsubsection{Topics}

I intend to explore what topics the various communities discuss in two ways:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Hashtags} Similar to how I will identify a community's representative words, I will determine its representative hashtags using weighted log-odds ratios.

	\item \textit{Topic Models} I will employ \citet{zuoWordNetworkTopic2016}'s Word
	Network Topic Model, a topic model shown to perform better than Latent
	Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) \cite{maierApplyingLDATopic2018} on short, social media text, to obtain
	each communities' latent topics (themes underlying their common discussion
	points); I will determine the number of topics to uncover for each community by
	evaluating the model's performance on topic coherence measures \cite{fangTopicsTweetsUser2016} in
	tandem with manual review. I will summarize captured topics by reviewing each
	topic's most prominent features along with its tagged tweets.

\end{itemize}

After collecting hashtags and latent topics, I will lay them out in a table and
analyze the communities' similarities and divergences.

\section{Idea Diffusion}

In this section, I detail how I probe \textit{whether} the AL helps diffuse AR
ideas and \textit{how} they might do so (RQ3).

I define an \textit{AR idea} as a text feature that has no or few
appearances in the dataset prior to being used by a non-trivial\footnote{Exact
number to be determined after more data inspection.} amount of AR community
members. An AR idea is \textit{diffused} into a community when a non-trivial
amount of community members employ it in their speech.

My inquiry into AR idea diffusion is best understood in three steps. I 
outline them here and go into greater detail in later subsections.

\begin{enumerate} 	\item I will identify ideas originating the AR community.
	\item I will model how ideas travel from one community to another using a
multivariate Hawkes process. This model will delineate how much influence the
various communities have over each other (e.g. How does what the general public
talk about affect what the AR talk about?), helping determine whether the AL
serve as a "conduit" for AR ideas. 	
\item I will predict whether an idea with origins
in the AR will make a later appearance in the general public's discourse using
an estimated logistic regression model. Inspecting this model will both
complement findings from the Hawkes process model and identify
non-community-related factors that play into AR idea diffusion. \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Detecting AR Ideas}
I will consider several potential ways to capture an "idea": unigrams, bigrams, 
hashtags, topic models, and contextualized word embeddings. I identify an idea as
\textit{AR ideas} if it meets two criteria: (1) it has no or few previous 
appearances in the dataset prior to being used by a sizeable amount of AR 
community members; (2) it is not used by non-AR community members at the time of its first appearance in the data.

\subsection{Modelling Diffusion as a Hawkes Process}

A point process is composed of events that occur at random intervals on
space-time axes; a temporal point process is composed of time-series data
concerning binary events occurring in continuous time
\cite{daleyIntroductionTheoryPoint2003, ogataSpaceTimePointProcessModels1998}.
Temporal point processes can be used to describe data with discretized time
points wherein an event may have occurred. A Hawkes process is a special point
process wherein the probability of an event occurring is increased by its
previous occurrences. Hawkes processes have been successfully used to model
information cascades, such as the spread of memes or rumors on social media
networks
\cite{luoMultiTaskMultiDimensionalHawkes2015,lukasikHawkesProcessesContinuous2016}.

I will slice my dataset into week-long bins and by community (AR, AL, and general
public). For each identified AR idea (along with some non-AR ideas to establish baselines for comparison), the data
will report, week by week, whether the idea was used and which community used
it. I will fit a multivariate Hawkes process on this dataset to estimate the
communities' influence on one another's discourse. Comparing the magnitudes of
estimated parameter values will reveal relative discursive influence. To perform
hypothesis testing on the parameter values, I will re-estimate my model from
parametric bootstrap samples \cite{reinhartReviewSelfExcitingSpatioTemporal2018}
and use a Bonferroni-corrected significance level to account for the
simultaneous multiple comparisons \cite{tanEffectWordingMessage2014}.

\subsection{Modelling Diffusion via a Logistic Regression}

I will fit a logistic regression to model whether an AR idea will eventually "diffuse" into the general public. More specifically, this
logistic regression will estimate whether, within the next week, a
non-trivial number of general public users will use an AR idea.

Out of potential models, I favor a logistic regression model for this task
because of its greater ease for interpretation and inference and it has
previously demonstrated superior ability to predict future popularity of newly
emergent hashtags \cite{maPredictingPopularityNewly2013}. Both contextual and
content features will be included as model features. Examples of contextual
features include features of the AR community graph and distance between the AR
and general public communities; examples of content features include the AR idea
represented as topic and sentiment vectors.

As I later infer from the fitted model, I will ascertain that the logistic
regression assumptions (such as independent error terms and absence of
multi-collinearity) are met. Steps to meet logistic regression assumptions will
include performing careful feature selection and estimating from parametric
bootstraps.

I will calculate $\chi^2$ statistics for each feature in my fitted model to
understand their relative importance. Features with a greater $\chi^2$ statistic
will be understood as a more influential mechanism in predicting whether an AR
idea is mainstreamed.

\section{Project Timetable}

Table \ref{table:timetable} describes my planned timeline for this projects' data collection and analysis procedures.

The broad strokes of my project timeline are: I will spend the rest of June data collecting and pre-processing; I will perform the analyses described in the "Community Snapshots" section in early July; I will dedicate the latter part of July along with the initial weeks of August to exploring diffusion of AR ideas. If all goes well, I should have a first draft of my precandidacy paper by the end of September.
